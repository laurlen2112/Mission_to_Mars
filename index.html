<h1>Pat McGrath Makeup Review:</h1>
    <p> one of my favorite pallets is the Pat McGrath Divine Rose 1 pallet.
         that pallet is amazaing because it contains wearable shades and a reformulated
         version of one her earlier highlighters.

        now that I have been wearing powder foundations I am loving her dual ended highlighting sticks
        the highlighters are subtle and the balm side can be used for multipupose.
