# Mission to Mars

## Overview:
The purpose of this challenge is to create an interactive web application with up-date information about Mars.  Various tools were used during the implementation process including: Python, [Mongo DB](https://github.com/laurlen2112/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/resources/mongo.png), HTML, and Bootstrap.  When the user activates the "scrape new data" button, code is triggered [to scrape](https://github.com/laurlen2112/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/resources/scraping_py%20snippet.png) pre-defined website data and return it to the application.  The [HTML code](https://github.com/laurlen2112/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/resources/html%20snippet.png),  along with a BootStrap template, creates the layout of the site.  A [Python file](https://github.com/laurlen2112/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/resources/app_py%20snippet.png) houses the Flask microframework, which allows the underlying code to be integrated into a web application.

These [before](https://github.com/laurlen2112/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/resources/before-scrap.png) and [after](https://github.com/laurlen2112/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/resources/after_scrape.png) images provide an example of different information on the application prior to and after a scrape.

Finally, the application is responsive to different screen sizes.  It is easily viewable on a [computer screen](https://github.com/laurlen2112/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/resources/full%20size.png), [tablet screen](https://github.com/laurlen2112/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/resources/tablet.png), and [cell phone](https://github.com/laurlen2112/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/resources/cell_phone.png).
